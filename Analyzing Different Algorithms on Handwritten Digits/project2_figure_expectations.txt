Make sure to explain results of graphs and in conclusions
explain why some perfomed the way they did cause->effect

abstract
introduction

Add the 4 methods in the method section

results seciton
put the results of the accuracy and method for all 4
metntion how many examples were used

conclusions 
extrapolate on teh results and why I got what I got
cause->effect.
